# JimenezChain: A Sovereign Municipal System
**Current Era:** V (Civilization)

## About the System
The JimenezChain is not merely a blockchain network; it is a **Sovereign Digital Municipality**. Evolving beyond the traditional ledger model, the system is architected as a functioning city government, complete with distinct departments for governance, defense, and logistics.

By treating code as law and processes as municipal services, JimenezChain bridges the gap between abstract decentralized technology and real-world sovereign infrastructure.

### The Municipal Metaphor
*   **City Hall (The Comptroller):** The central nervous system handling governance, port assignment, and treasury permits.
*   **Jimenez Military Base:** A defensive layer providing active port scanning, DEFCON security levels, and threat neutralization.
*   **Jimenez Int'l Airport:** The logistics hub where the Mempool becomes "International Airspace," and transactions are "Incoming Flights" requiring customs clearance.
*   **The Treasury:** A Zero Point Energy facility that transmutes foreign digital assets (BTC, SOL) into Sovereign Mainnet Liquidity.
